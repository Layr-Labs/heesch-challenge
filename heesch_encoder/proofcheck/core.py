"""Core-CNF proof checking (architecture §13.3 step 5b).

A refutation of a SUBSET C of the regenerated formula F refutes F: every
model of F satisfies C, so C unsatisfiable ⇒ F unsatisfiable, for RUP and
RAT steps alike (RAT preserves satisfiability of C; the conclusion does not
depend on F). The submitter may therefore hand the checker only the clauses
the proof actually uses — typically a few percent of F (measured 3.5 % for
an F(S,6) instance) — which is what makes record-scale checking fit the
formally-verified checker's heap.

Soundness rests on ONE thing we do here: every clause of C must be, exactly,
a clause of F. So

  * the submitter's core file is parsed with a strict grammar (one clause
    per line, integers, 0-terminated, no comments) and each clause is
    canonicalised (duplicate literals removed, literals in the encoder's
    frozen order — heesch_encoder.ordering.literal_key, the order F itself is
    emitted in);
  * membership is EXACT string equality against F's own DIMACS lines,
    streamed once (no hashing, no probabilistic structure);
  * the checker never sees the submitter's bytes: the core CNF handed to it
    is written by us and consists solely of F's own lines, in the
    submitter's chosen order (their LRAT ids are positions in that order),
    under a header naming F's variable count.

Any clause not found, any tautology, any grammar deviation ⇒ the proof is
rejected before a checker runs. Caps bound the work (a core as large as F
buys nothing and is refused).
